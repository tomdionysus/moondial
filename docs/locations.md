# Greenhouse
The greenhouse is a huge, vaulted edifice of white painted steel and glass, overrun now with ivy. Built in four wings, the building centres on a large circle containing a huge stone pool and fountain, with gravel paths running out like spokes. Inside, long rows of plants both beautiful and hideous line the paths. The air is hot and humid, and smells of earth and baked clay. The water in the fountain gurgles softly, and misters hiss gently on the plants.

# Great Hall
The huge hall is paved with black and white marble tiles, laid out like a huge chessboard. Oak panelling adorns the walls leading aloft to vaulted ceilings of plaster. A dusty haze fills the air, throwing long spears of light into relief from tall windows, curtained with heavy red velvet that is threadbare in places.
